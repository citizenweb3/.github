# Citizen Web3

## 🌍 Mission
Citizen Web3 is a non-custodial, self-hosted infrastructure provider and an active member of the web3 galaxy. We are blockchain agnostic, censorship-resistant, and value-driven by the goals of cypherpunks. We build off-the-grid infrastructure hosted in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. We focus on privacy networks first-hand. We believe in decentralization, cross-ecosystem collaboration, and technological sovereignty. Born in 2020 (formerly Citizen Cosmos), our mission is to grow the Web3 space by creating infrastructure, sharing knowledge, and empowering communities—without tribalism.

> *Blockchains are digital nations. We build open-source tools, provide off the grid infrastructure to support the prosperity of these new digital societies.*

## 📝 Manifesto

> "From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam... Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves..."  
> *— From 'A Pale Blue Dot', by Carl Sagan.*

We believe in freedom above needs, possibilities above enforcement, and values above desires. We strive for a Web3 defined by communication, cross-ecosystem respect, privacy and collective growth.

May the code be with you.
