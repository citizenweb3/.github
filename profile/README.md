# Citizen Cosmos

## TL;DR

Citizen Cosmos is an ecosystem developer in the web3 universe. In simple terms, this means that we are somewhat of a `city manager`, working directly - for, and with the city and its citizens, read - token holders. This is opposed to working with a third party, i.e. someone that represents the voice of the people, like a mayor. The catch is, our cities are decentralized, censorship-free, open and verifiable blockchain networks. Hence, we are not a mayor or a third party, we are part of the voice of a community. 

We believe that blockchains should be viewed as digital nations and by using the tools that we hold, we help to build and bring value to these nations. Our tools vary, but for now include a web3-focused podcast, streams, social media, educational content, hackathons, distributed validator infrastructure and our offline network, which allows us to help dev teams to form strategic partnerships, especially at earlier stages. 

We are also starting to work with offline projects, such as local artists, galleries, permaculture communities, etc. Helping educate them about crypto, and sometimes, investing into them by donating crypto.

What's in it for us? We monetize ourselves via our [validators](https://www.citizencosmos.space/staking). If we believe that a `city` can be prosperous and it meets our values, we start to work around it. In turn, the citizens of the city, read - blockchain users, delegate tokens to our validators, which helps us to keep going.

For now, Citizen Cosmos is primarily focused on Tendermint, Cosmos-SDK and Ethereum, but not only. Our podcast is focused on the interchain, and we validate Cosmos-based networks. We cover events as a media outlet, organize and sponsor events, create educational content and help people to dive into the rabbit hole. 

Our goals are much bigger. We strive and build to becoming the layer-0, i.e. - a community bridge between ecosystem. Running more nodes, creating more content, forming more partnerships, etc. 

On our GitHub you may find some docs, strategic tasks and issues, which will help you to understand our roadmap, see where we plan to go next, etc. Some include our slightly crazier ideas for the long term, such as, launching a DAO, NFT tokens, an own blockchain and so on.

## Q&A

#### Q. Who are you?
**A.** Citizen Cosmos is an ecosystem developer focused on developing the greater community of the interchain. It is currently run by a small team of individuals, with a long-term focus on decentralizing the project.  

#### Q. What do you do?
**A.** Citizen Cosmos runs validator infrastructure, produces podcasts, streams, creates educational content, helps to sponsor and organize events, helps to connect teams, helps teams to form partnerships, building tools, etc.

#### Q. Why do you do it?
**A.** The team behind Citizen Cosmos created the project based on our values and goals to create a better and a more decentralized future for the world.

#### Q. What are your values?
**A.** Open source, decentralization, freedom of speech, categorical imperatives, lack of enforcement, lack of censorship, lack of violence.

#### Q. What problem are you trying to solve?
**A.** The bigger, long-term issue Citizen Cosmos is trying to solve is the lack of communication between communities, projects and teams.

#### Q. Where can I find it?
**A.** You can find the [Citizen Cosmos website here](https://www.citizencosmos.space/) and all the links to our social media and work are on there too.

#### Q. Do you have further plans?
**A.** Yes. They are to become the layer-0 for various communities. You may also follow our tasks to be in focus with our current plans.

#### Q. What's in it for me?
**A.** Citizen Cosmos already offers a source of knowledge, which can help you to filter the bad from the ugly, and the good from the bad. This can help to make staking decisions (by learning from about the validator values on our shows), decide whether or not to be a part of a project and how decentralized it is, etc. In the future Citizen Cosmos plans to offer such tools and incentives as NFT's, a DAO, etc

## Manifesto

> From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam... Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves...

From 'A Pale Blue Dot', by Carl Sagan.

We believe in freedom above needs. We believe in possibilities above enforcement. We believe in values above desires. We believe that censorship has killed more people than anything else together combined. We value honesty and we value the truth. We value love and cherish all existing creatures. We value intelligence and we value decentralization. 

We believe in communication, which allows participants to think, make their mind up and cast personal votes on any topic and subject. We think that content should strive to lack subjective opinions and help its consumers to form an opinion, which will result in better discussion, and in turn in a more efficient consensus. 

We believe that blockchains are not simply a form of digital nations. But, open and verifiable blockchains are somewhat similar to natural hives, forests, patterns in the nature that allow us to communicate better. Without communication, we are doomed, and decentralized consensus is a tool that can and will help those who desire to make our pale blue dot a slightly better place.
