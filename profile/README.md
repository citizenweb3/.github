# Citizen Web3

(Previously Citizen Cosmos)

## TL;DR

Citizen Web3 was born out of years of community management and ecosystem development. Today, Citizen Web3 is a project providing infrastructure services as a validator across the blockchain space, one of the oldest web3 podcasts in the space and a community of like-minded people. Our flagship product, validatorinfo.com is a dashboard and an explorer that helps you to discover validators across the space.   

We believe that blockchains should be viewed as digital nations and by using the tools that we hold, we help to build and bring value to these nations. We monetize ourselves via our [validators](https://www.citizencosmos.space/staking). If we believe that a `city` can be prosperous, and it meets our values, we start to work around it. In turn, the citizens of the city, read - blockchain users, delegate tokens to our validators, which helps us to keep going.

Our goals are much bigger. We strive and build to becoming the layer-0, i.e. - a community bridge between ecosystems. Running more nodes, creating more content, forming more partnerships, etc. 

## Manifesto

> From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam... Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves...

From 'A Pale Blue Dot', by Carl Sagan.

We believe in freedom above needs. We believe in possibilities above enforcement. We believe in values above desires. We believe that censorship has killed more people than anything else together combined. We value honesty and we value the truth. We value love and cherish all existing creatures. We value intelligence and we value decentralization. 

We believe in communication, which allows participants to think, make their mind up and cast personal votes on any topic and subject. We think that content should strive to lack subjective opinions and help its consumers to form an opinion, which will result in better discussion, and in turn in a more efficient consensus. 

We believe that blockchains are not simply a form of digital nations. But, open and verifiable blockchains are somewhat similar to natural hives, forests, patterns in the nature that allow us to communicate better. Without communication, we are doomed, and decentralized consensus is a tool that can and will help those who desire to make our pale blue dot a slightly better place.
