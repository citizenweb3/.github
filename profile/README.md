# Citizen Web3

(previously Citizen Cosmos)

## TL;DR

Citizen Web3, as a project, started in 2020. Finding roots in ancap vibes, personal values in building a better society, ecosystem development and networking. Today, Citizen Web3 is an active member of the web3 galaxy. We are blockchain agnostic and decentralization maximalists. We provide noncustodial, off the grid infrastructure as a validator across the blockchain space. This allows us to work on various public goods, and contribute to the development of web3.  

Our public good projects: 
- [Citizen Web3 Podcast](https://www.citizenweb3.com/episodes): discovering those that contribute to building the decentralized world and turn code into web3 applications
- [ValidatorInfo.com](https://validatorinfo.com): multichain, Proof of Work and Proof of Stake explorer / dashboard, focused on mining pools and validators, across the web3 galaxy 
- [Web3 Society:](https://t.me/web_3_society) a community that resents tribalism. With a focus on helping and learning.Including future DAO incentives (NA at the moment) 
- [Validator Infra](https://www.citizenweb3.com/staking): self-hosted, bare-metal infrastructure. Independent off the grid infra, including public endpoints, testnets, archive nodes and relaying
- [B.V.C.](https://bvc.citizenweb3.com/): baremetal valdiator coven. A community for selfhosted and baremetal validators. 
- (NA at the moment) Bazaar: NFTs, Merchandise, Decentraland 

We believe that blockchains should be viewed as digital nations. By using the tools that we hold, we help to build and bring value to these nations. Once we believe that a `city` can be prosperous, and it meets our values, we start to work around it. In turn, the citizens of the city, read - blockchain users, delegate tokens to our validator - Citizen Web3.

We believe in a decentralized web3 without tribalism. In better communication between various ecosystems. We dream of a web3 with infrastructure independent off the grid. A web3 without enforcement.

## Manifesto

> From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam... Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves...

From 'A Pale Blue Dot', by Carl Sagan.

We believe in freedom above needs. We believe in possibilities above enforcement. We believe in values above desires. We believe that censorship has killed more people than anything else together combined. We value honesty and we value the truth. We value love and cherish all existing creatures. We value intelligence and we value decentralization. 

We believe in communication, which allows participants to think, make their mind up and cast personal votes on any topic and subject. We think that content should strive to lack subjective opinions and help its consumers to form their own opinion. Hence, resulting in better discussion, and in turn in a more efficient consensus. 

We believe that blockchains are not simply a form of digital nations. But, open and verifiable blockchains are somewhat similar to natural hives, forests, patterns in the nature that allow us to communicate better. Without communication, we are doomed, and decentralized consensus is a tool, that can and will help, those that desire to make our pale blue dot a slightly better place.
