# Citizen Web3

(Previously Citizen Cosmos)

## TL;DR

Citizen Web3 was born in 2020, starting its foundations in anarcho-cap ideas, personal interest in creating a better society, community management, ecosystem development and networking. Today, Citizen Web3 is an active member and builder of the web3 galaxy. We provide infrastrucure as a validator across the blockchain space, which allows us to work on various public goods projects and develop the space. 

Our public projects include: 
- One of the oldest [web3 podcasts, about people that make web3 a reality](https://www.citizencosmos.space) 
- Our flagship product, validatorinfo.com is a dashboard and an explorer that helps you to discover validators across the space (in the making)
- [Web3 Society:](https://t.me/web_3_society) a community against tribalism
- Public infrastructure
- (NA at the moment) Bazaar: NFTs, Merchandise, Decentraland
- [A community](https://t.me/citizen_web_3) that earns incintives (NA at the moment)   

We believe that blockchains should be viewed as digital nations and by using the tools that we hold, we help to build and bring value to these nations. We help building those nations by helping to secure them, along with other [validators](https://www.citizencosmos.space/staking). If we believe that a `city` can be prosperous, and it meets our values, we start to work around it. In turn, the citizens of the city, read - blockchain users, delegate tokens to Citizen Web3.

Our dream is a decentralized web3 without tribalism, and with better communication between all L0's aka the communities, between various ecosystems across all the blockchain space.  

## Manifesto

> From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam... Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves...

From 'A Pale Blue Dot', by Carl Sagan.

We believe in freedom above needs. We believe in possibilities above enforcement. We believe in values above desires. We believe that censorship has killed more people than anything else together combined. We value honesty and we value the truth. We value love and cherish all existing creatures. We value intelligence and we value decentralization. 

We believe in communication, which allows participants to think, make their mind up and cast personal votes on any topic and subject. We think that content should strive to lack subjective opinions and help its consumers to form an opinion, which will result in better discussion, and in turn in a more efficient consensus. 

We believe that blockchains are not simply a form of digital nations. But, open and verifiable blockchains are somewhat similar to natural hives, forests, patterns in the nature that allow us to communicate better. Without communication, we are doomed, and decentralized consensus is a tool that can and will help those who desire to make our pale blue dot a slightly better place.
